# Pre‐Departure Preparation
## Visa Application
Things to look out for during the visa interview.
* **Triple-check all your information** before you submit your Visa application/going the [US Embassy](https://share.google/AukdTSaWGmUwNNIs0). They are very strict in this part.
* Be confident during the interview. Do not make unnecessary jokes.
* Clear your social media.

## Flight Booking
* Once the school confirms the start dates, book as early as possible. If you want to travel before or after the term starts, make sure you leave enough time. The last official day of school is the Friday of the last week, consider that when making plans.
* Students are required to check in by a specific date (announced by the school). Late check-in will incur a USD $100 late fee per person.

[Back to Top](#Redmond-Table-of-Content)

## Financial Preparations
### Cash 
* Bring enough if you are buying second-hand stuff (such as a car, furniture), easier than using card, only DBS/OCBC/UOB cars allow to withdraw a large amount in the state.
* Cash is not really used much in the USA outside of Facebook Marketplace (second-hand stuff mentioned above), but please make sure to have some just in case. 
### Can I use cards? 
* If you have a multi-currency account (DBS has one), you can open one and put USD in it and get a debit card. This will automatically use the USD and you won’t have to do the conversion per transaction.
* You can also use apps like YouTrip and Revolut (Revolut has a built-in group split feature), they work similarly, and it’s easier to transfer money to your friends. 
* Online transaction with cards works most of the time.

[Back to Top](#Redmond-Table-of-Content)

## Packing Essentials
### Is there anything we should pack before going to USA, and it may be hard to get in the states?
* Make sure to bring at least 2 adapters and at least 2 Power Strip per house for your electronics, due to the lack of these utilities provided by the school.
* Clips and/or rubber bands may be useful to bring to seal up your food & ingredients.
* Bring reusable bags and/or plastic bags! If you have to get a bag at the grocery store, it can be anywhere from a few cents up to like 20 to 25 cents! Do not need to bring trash bags unless otherwise stated, each accommodation is given a box of trash bags that can last throughout the semester.
* Bring your personal medication as necessary, painkillers, fever, flu, medicated plaster for bruises and sprains(Tiger balm or anything related) , and burn aid.
* Any Lithium-ion batteries must be hand-carried, so basically chargers and power banks, CCD cameras, etc.

### NO GO
* DO NOT bring fresh food.
* DO NOT bring anything that even visualy assemble like a weapon, especially fire arms.

# Adapting to Life in Redmond & DigiPen
Redmond is a quiet suburb which is pretty clean and safe. You will be staying near downtown, so it is more walkable than other places in the USA. Here are some tips for adapting, especially if you’ve never been to the USA or overseas before:
* Do not do price conversions to SGD, or you will become depressed. $10 is $10, not SGD$13.
* Sales tax is state and city dependent, and is added on at the end, not included in the price tag. So buying an item in Redmond will have a different tax than in Seattle, for example.
  * The current tax rate in Redmond is 10.3%, as of 7 Apr 2025.
  * Groceries are not taxed, but the definition is rather strict and on a per-item basis, so going into a grocery store does not mean everything in it is tax free.
* Tipping is a thing for dining (and quite a few other things).
  * Tip if you sit down and are served. If you have to pick up the food at the counter, you won’t be expected to tip (but the POS system might still ask you).
  * Generally, 15% is enough. Some places might show the lowest default option to be 18% or even 20% or more.
  * **Just tip** if unsure, don’t not tip unless the service was really terrible.
* Americans like small talk. Just be nice and polite and you’ll blend in.
  * This also applies to class. Professors build their class around people asking questions and having discussions, so don’t paiseh. If there are Americans in your class, you will hear them a lot. Just don’t overdo your participation and derail the class.
* Don’t max out your heater 24/7, they are not meant to do that and could get damaged.
* Don’t use the whole bathroom for showering, only the designated area is waterproof, the rest is not and will cause water damage.
* When going out for the day, check the weather forecast beforehand! Just because it is hot when you leave the house doesn’t mean it will be that way when you come back, so pack and dress accordingly. Night time can be extremely cold. 
* Despite Redmond being pretty safe, it’s still not as safe as Singapore, so don’t go leaving your stuff around anyhow. Low crime =/= no crime.
* Remember that the legal drinking age in the USA is 21, not 18 and always bring along your passport if you want to purchase any.
* Healthcare in the USA is extremely expensive. If you get sick, try to self medicate or see a pharmacist first. Ask someone whose parents are doctors. Only if it’s pretty severe should you go to a doctor.
  * On that note, if you are sick and cannot go for class, instead of an MC, you just message the professor on teams in advance to let them know you can’t come and why. Depending on their policy, they may stream the class for you so you can join from home.
* Campus and the library opens from 6am to midnight 7 days a week, even during holidays.
  * Generally a really cozy place to study and do work. Should be rather quiet too as it is Summer.
  * DigiPen shuttle: https://calendly.com/dragonride 
    * Shuttle bus between campus and all 4 complexes (and the transit center)
    * Book the timing you want, then show the confirmation email to the driver.
    * Slots are limited and open exactly 72 hours in advance, and might fill up quick depending on how many of yall get a car. So eg slots for Friday 11am will open on Tuesday 11am.
  * Cafe hours and menu: https://digipenbytes.myshopify.com/ 
    * Food options change every day
      * Buy the food at the store, then take the receipt to the serving area.
    * Also has the merch store (in person).
  * Campus may or may not be open 24 hours during finals week, check Student Announcements teams channel (you will need to join it)
* If you get an escooter or bike, please remember safety first! There are always 10s of injuries every year within the first week of getting escooters from the Singaporeans. Practise at open space before you actually go on the road. 
  * Wear long sleeves and long pants with covered shoes.
  * Wear a helmet. It is mandated by the law.
  * If you are going to/from school, there’s a park connector, use that when you can as it’s a smooth road compared to the sidewalk.
  * Have a light and some high vis gear when going out while dark.
  * You have to ride on the road not pavement.

# Grocery Shopping
There are a lot of options for shopping in Redmond and around the area. Here are some popular options (distances if given are measured from The Knoll, as that is the most “central” of the 4 complexes):
## Regular
### QFC (~1km, 15min walk) (“Small” QFC)
15800 Redmond Way, Redmond, WA 98052
General grocery store, can sign up for the membership card for free for discounts.
### Trader Joe’s (Next to QFC)
15932 Redmond Way, Redmond, WA 98052
More “organic” grocery store, but don’t be fooled as prices can be quite a bit cheaper than QFC. Currently probably the best place to get regular priced eggs (brown eggs too)
### QFC (~1.7km, 25min walk) (“Big” QFC)
8867 161st Avenue Northeast, Redmond, WA 98052
Bigger QFC with more options. This area is also where the movie theater is.
### Safeway (~2.4km, 35min walk, recommend bus)
17246 Redmond Way, Redmond, WA 98052
Another grocery store similar to QFC. Can sign up for membership for discounts using phone number. Generally a little more expensive than QFC.
### Fred Meyer (~2.9km, 40min walk, recommend bus)
17667 NE 76th St, Redmond, WA 98052
Another grocery store. May have cheaper options than QFC. Can use QFC membership at Fred Meyer.
### Target (~3km, 40min walk, recommend bus)
17700 NE 76th St, Redmond, WA 98052
Bigger store, sells groceries and other household items like appliances and furniture.
### Costco (~4km, not recommended without car)
7725 188th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052
Most value place for bulk purchase
Membership required ($65), sells stuff wholesale, so really good for big portions. Good price for eggs too if you are buying in bulk. Also has their famous food court which sells the $1.50 hotdog + refillable drink combo and their $10 huge pizza. Almost a tourist attraction on its own.

## Asian
As a general rule, don’t buy anything Asian from the regular stores’ Asian aisle, buy from the Asian stores. Especially Indomie…
### H-Mart (~2.1km, 30min walk)
Good price and alot of Korean asian food 
7589 170th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052
A Korean grocery store chain, but sells many things you may want for Singaporean cooking. 
### Asian Family Mart (~6.1km, recommend bus/car)
14515 NE 20th St, Bellevue, WA 98007
Can always go here if you have a car
A much bigger Asian store which is mainly Chinese, but sells a ton of SEA stuff too. The area it’s in also has plenty of Asian food and other services in it.
### T&T (~18.4km, take car)
12620 SE 41st Pl, Bellevue, WA 98006
Alot of things and great value, super far tho
The legendary drop of Asian stores in the area. Newly opened, it sells just about everything from Asia, yes even Singaporean stuff. It also has a food court.
### Weee! (ONLINE)
https://www.sayweee.com/en , or download their app (might be region locked idk)
Has some rare finds you may not be able to get elsewhere. Since they are an online store, they deliver to you, so it may be more convenient. There is a minimum spend for free delivery and service charge waive so try to bulk order for your house/group of houses. Don’t forget to tip the delivery man, $1-3 is adequate.

# Academic and Career Planning
borrow calculator or calculator model to look out for
* For CS students, you will be taking MAT250 Linear Algebra. While not required, it helps a lot to have a graphic calculator that can do Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF), as that’s basically what you learn throughout the whole class. You can borrow from the library, but slots are limited and everyone has the same idea, so either be quick, get your own, or just do it by hand.
  * As of OIP 2025, a graphic calculator is no longer allowed in exams. You may still bring one if you wish to for handy calculations when studying.
* Plagiarism and other academic integrity violations are taken more seriously here. What you might have gotten away with in SG you probably won’t in Redmond. Ask the 30+ people who instantly failed CS380(Ai) for plagiarising one project last year.
Do not copy any single line from your friends, it's really not difficult.

# Renting or Buying a Car as a Student in Redmond, USA
## Understanding Driving in the USA as a Singaporean

## Buying a Car
### Should You Buy?
If you and your friends want, it may be a good idea since you can split the costs. If you want to explore further areas, it may be a good idea too. Grocery shopping in bulk is also easier with a car.
### Where to Buy?
* New Cars
* Used Cars: Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Carvana, CarMax.
### Things to Look Out for When Buying
* titleship (clean title only)  do not get any rebuild or salvage title
* get toyota, honda or lexus only if possible 
* ford or cadillac is ok 
* Ask for carfax (report where you know if there any major issues)
* Car plate validity (able to last at least 4-5mth)
* Get it from a personal buyer, check for major items like engine, transmission, brakes and steering. If you can cfm the wanted car, you may send to mechanic to have a full inspection (addition $220, it should not exceed $250)
* Find car from facebook market 
* Ask for the condition and vin number 
* Check for carfax 
* Meet up for test drive 
* Price negotiation
* Ask if can sell if as gift
* Check titleship (a pink certificate *must a valid, its different from a printed paper)
* Go to a DMV or equivalent license shop to transfer the ownership 
* Fyi it takes 1mth to get the title to ship to your apartment 
* Dealership can also nego on the price, Bigname companies $200-1000, family companies $500-$2000
### Cost Breakdown
* Car price 
* Sales tax (~10% in Washington State). 
* how to save money? Maybe get the car from oregon
* Registration & Title transfer (~$100-$300).
* Insurance (~$100-$200/month).
### Registration & Title Transfer (For Car Buyers)
* Required when buying a car (done at Washington Department of Licensing (DOL)).
* Documents needed:
  * Bill of Sale (from seller).
  * Title Certificate (proof of ownership).
  * Emissions test (if required).
* Registration Fee: ~$100-$300.
* If you are buying from a dealership, they will probably handle it all for you.
* Once you register your car at the DOL, you will get a new licence plate and receive a registration. Your title deed will come in the mail in about 4-6 weeks.
* The title is the most important document. Do not lose it, and when you sell the car make sure you have it to give to the buyer.

# Traffic rules you may not be aware of
* Traffic signs are all almost entirely written out, so no need to guess what symbol means what.
* On a red light, you can turn right if it is safe to do so(Red on right), unless there is a sign prohibiting it (e.g. NO RIGHT TURN ON RED)
* Some left turns have special conditions where you can turn if it is safe outside of a green arrow, which will be displayed at the light (e.g. the light at school is a LEFT TURN YIELD ON GREEN, meaning on a green light, you can turn left but need to yield to oncoming traffic/pedestrians)
* On a lot of roads, there is a middle lane known as the turning lane. Do not go into this lane unless you are going to turn. If you are turning left into a road with a turning lane but no traffic light, turn out into the turning lane, move forward a little bit, then merge into the regular lane when it is safe to do so. Stop if you need to, rather than continue moving if you can’t merge yet.
* Alots hostel and ruleless driver, always maintain 3 second rule and be patient. Ignore the horn and drive safely
* Parking on the hill, always turn your wheels inwards. 
* Always pay parking on the roadside else your car might get toll away esp in canada

# Current Affairs
* For the most part, you will not be affected much by the current administration due to your short term stay.
* Some items are going to have weird costs, the biggest being eggs.
  * Due to ongoing bird flu since late last year + the current administration, egg prices are very high now.
  * However, some places still sell eggs at a decent (pre all this) price, the closest to you being Trader Joe’s
* Due to Trump’s tariffs, prepare for your Asian groceries to increase in price (effects to be seen).
* If you see a protest, do not interact with it. You are a foreigner, you will get in trouble.
* If you have any problems, you should go find International Student Affairs (Either Amee or Minjung depending on who’s around). You can message them on teams or find them in person in school (Level 3, turn right from the lift lobby and go pretty much all the way to the end).

[Back to Top](#Redmond-Table-of-Content)

# The Imperial measurement system
You don’t need to learn the imperial system properly for such a short stay, so here are some easy approximations you can use to agar your way through, and also the exact measurement.
* 1lb ~= 0.5kg
  * 1lb = 451g
* 1 gal ~= 4L
  * 1 gal = 3.8L
* 1 mi ~= 1.5 km
  * 1 mi = 1.6 km
* 3 ft ~= 1m
  * 1ft = 30cm

For temperature, here are some useful numbers:
* 70F ~= 22C
* 80F ~= 26C
* 90F ~= 32C
* 100F ~= 37.6C (Fever temperature)
* C → F : 9/5 * C + 32
* F → C : 5/9 * (F - 32)
