# Pre‚ÄêDeparture Preparation
## Visa Application
Things to look out for during the visa interview.
* Triple-check all your information before you submit your Visa application. They are very strict in this part.
* Be confident during the interview. Do not make unnecessary jokes.
* Clear your social media.

## Flight Booking
* Once the school confirms the start dates, book as early as possible. If you want to travel before or after the term starts, make sure you leave enough time. The last official day of school is the Friday of the last week, consider that when making plans.
* Students are required to check in by a specific date (announced by the school). Late check-in will incur a USD $100 late fee per person.

## Financial Preparations
### Cash¬†
* Bring enough if you are buying second-hand stuff (such as a car, furniture), easier than using card, only DBS/OCBC/UOB cars allow to withdraw a large amount in the state.
* Cash is not really used much in the USA outside of Facebook Marketplace (second-hand stuff mentioned above), but please make sure to have some just in case.¬†
### Can I use cards?¬†
* If you have a multi-currency account (DBS has one), you can open one and put USD in it and get a debit card. This will automatically use the USD and you won‚Äôt have to do the conversion per transaction.
* You can also use apps like YouTrip and Revolut (Revolut has a built-in group split feature), they work similarly, and it‚Äôs easier to transfer money to your friends. 
* Online transaction with cards works most of the time.

## Packing Essentials
Is there anything we should pack before going to USA, and it may be hard to get in the states?
Make sure to bring at least 2 adapters and at least 2 Power Strip per house for your electronics, due to the lack of these utilities provided by the school.
Clips and/or rubber bands may be useful to bring to seal up your food & ingredients.
Bring reusable bags and/or plastic bags! If you have to get a bag at the grocery store, it can be anywhere from a few cents up to like 20 to 25 cents! Do not need to bring trash bags unless otherwise stated, each accommodation is given a box of trash bags that can last throughout the semester.
Bring your personal medication as necessary, painkillers, fever, flu, medicated plaster for bruises and sprains(Tiger balm or anything related) , and burn aid.
Any Lithium-ion batteries must be hand-carried, so basically chargers and power banks, CCD cameras, etc.
